2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ports/clk05_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ports/data_to_cpu[7]_i_1/O, cell ports/data_to_cpu[7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net regFile/file_reg[2][0]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin regFile/virtual_SP_reg[0]_LDC_i_1/O, cell regFile/virtual_SP_reg[0]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net regFile/file_reg[2][1]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin regFile/virtual_SP_reg[1]_LDC_i_1/O, cell regFile/virtual_SP_reg[1]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net regFile/file_reg[2][2]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin regFile/virtual_SP_reg[2]_LDC_i_1/O, cell regFile/virtual_SP_reg[2]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net regFile/file_reg[2][3]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin regFile/virtual_SP_reg[3]_LDC_i_1/O, cell regFile/virtual_SP_reg[3]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net regFile/file_reg[2][4]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin regFile/virtual_SP_reg[4]_LDC_i_1/O, cell regFile/virtual_SP_reg[4]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net regFile/file_reg[2][5]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin regFile/virtual_SP_reg[5]_LDC_i_1/O, cell regFile/virtual_SP_reg[5]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net regFile/file_reg[2][6]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin regFile/virtual_SP_reg[6]_LDC_i_1/O, cell regFile/virtual_SP_reg[6]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#9 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net regFile/file_reg[2][7]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin regFile/virtual_SP_reg[7]_LDC_i_1/O, cell regFile/virtual_SP_reg[7]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT ports/data_to_cpu[7]_i_1 is driving clock pin of 18 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
ports/HLT_flag_reg, ports/data_to_cpu_reg[0], ports/data_to_cpu_reg[1], ports/data_to_cpu_reg[2], ports/data_to_cpu_reg[3], ports/data_to_cpu_reg[4], ports/data_to_cpu_reg[5], ports/data_to_cpu_reg[6], ports/data_to_cpu_reg[7], ports/intr_flag_reg, ports/out_port_reg[0], ports/out_port_reg[1], ports/out_port_reg[2], ports/out_port_reg[3], ports/out_port_reg[4] (the first 15 of 18 listed)
Related violations: <none>
